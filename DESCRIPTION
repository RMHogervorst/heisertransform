Description: An implementation of heiser (2004) that helps to visually display
        relative probabilities to categorical assignment. Vertices,
        representing the relative frequency of the categories, form the corners
        of a triangle. Individual points in the triangle have a relative
        position based on strength of association towards the vertices
        (category). Thus points closer to a vertice have a larger probability
        towards that category. This triangle approach is distinct from other
        triangle plots known as terniary plots, trilinear diagrams or
        triplots where every side of the triangle displays a dimension,
        effectively creating a triangular coordinate system.
        In our approach the relative probabilities are transformed to an
        euclidian 2-dimensional space, making direct distance comparisons
        possible. This package creates the vertices and coordinates for three
        categorical probabilities that can be plotted with the plotting system
        of your choice. For background information, the method and higher
        dimensional generalizations: Geometric representation of association

Based on Heiser 2004, this package transforms probability to belong to
    one of 3 categories, as is a result from multinomial regression,
    into points in a 2d space. Probabilities of every row (case) are
    than transformed into xy coordinates so that points are arranged in proportion
    to probability.
    When plotted the points are in a triangle that represents the
    3 categories and the distance towards the points of the triangle represent
    probability of belonging to this cluster.
    Each sample  is  located  at  a  centroid  (barycenter,
    center of gravity)  of the three  vertices,  weighted by the relative
    frequency of each  category in  that  sample, and each individual point is
    in turn located at the centroid of its  constituent samples,  weighted by
    their sample sizes.  Thus, we can read off the strength of association
    between countries and attachment categories from the triangular diagram by
    assessing their relative position towards the vertices in the plot.
    This triangle approach is distinct
    from other triangle approaches such as terniary plots, trilinear or triplots
    where every side of the triangle displays a dimension. This contrasts with
    the heisertransformation which is truely two dimensional and euclidian.
