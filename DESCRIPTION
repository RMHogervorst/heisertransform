Description: An implementation of heiser (2004) that helps to visually display
        relative probabilities to categorical assignment. Vertices,
        representing the relative frequency of the categories, form the corners
        of a triangle. Individual points in the triangle have a relative
        position based on strength of association towards the vertices
        (category). Thus points closer to a vertice have a larger probability
        towards that category. This triangle approach is distinct from other
        triangle plots known as terniary plots, trilinear diagrams or
        triplots where every side of the triangle displays a dimension,
        effectively creating a triangular coordinate system.
        In our approach the relative probabilities are transformed to an
        euclidian 2-dimensional space, making direct distance comparisons
        possible. This package creates the vertices and coordinates for three
        categorical probabilities that can be plotted with the plotting system
        of your choice. For background information, the method and higher
        dimensional generalizations: Geometric representation of association
