Description: Based on Heiser 2004, this package transforms 3 categories of f.i.
    multinomial regression into points in a 2d space. Probabilities of every row are
    than transformed into xy coordinates so that points are arranged in proportion
    to probability. When plotted the points are in a triangle that represents the
    3 categories and the distance towards the points of the triangle represent
    probability of belonging to this cluster.See also: Geometric representation of
    association between categories, 2004 , Psychometrika VOL. 69, NO. 4, 513-545.
